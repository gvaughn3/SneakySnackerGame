Sneaky Snacker
Game Instructions

Sneaky Snacker is a stealth-based platforming game where you play as a raccoon trying to collect food without being caught by humans. The goal is to collect one hundred points worth of pickles before time runs out. Each pickle is worth ten points. Pickles must be returned to your home base (the starting area) for the points to count.

You can move using the arrow keys or WASD, aim your slingshot with the mouse, and charge and shoot by holding and releasing the left mouse button. You can pick up and throw jars to break them with E, or use your slingshot to shatter them from a distance. Breaking jars releases pickles that can be collected.

Enemies patrol the map with flashlights. If you are caught in their light, you drop all your collected pickles and are sent back to your spawn point. You can hide in bushes to avoid detection. If the timer runs out before you return your pickles to base, you lose a life. You also lose a life if you are caught. Losing all three lives results in game over.

Game Walkthrough

You start at your home base. From there, explore the nearby area and look for glass pickle jars. Use your slingshot or throw jars to break them open and collect the pickles inside. Keep an eye on enemy patrols and use bushes for cover.

Once you have some pickles, return to your home base to secure your points. If you’re caught before returning, you’ll lose everything you’ve gathered. Continue exploring and collecting until you have banked one hundred points. If time expires or you run out of lives, the game ends. If you reach one hundred points, you win.
